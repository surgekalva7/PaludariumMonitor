## 1. Monitor Environmental Conditions
- **Temperature**:
  - Air: 75–85°F (adjust for species).
  - Water: 72–78°F (adjust for aquatic species).
  - Use reliable thermometers for both air and water.
- **Humidity**:
  - Maintain 70–90% humidity for tropical setups using a hygrometer.
  - Regulate humidity with misters or foggers.
- **Lighting**:
  - Provide UVB lighting for reptiles and amphibians as needed.
  - Use full-spectrum grow lights for plants.
  - Ensure a 12-hour day/night cycle.
- **Airflow**:
  - Ensure proper ventilation to prevent mold while retaining moisture.

## 2. Assess Water Quality
- **Clarity**:
  - Water should be clean and clear without foul odors.
- **Chemical Parameters**:
  - pH: Maintain appropriate levels (e.g., 6.5–7.5 for tropical fish).
  - Ammonia and Nitrites: 0 ppm.
  - Nitrates: Below 20–40 ppm.
  - Use a water test kit to monitor these values.
- **Filtration**:
  - Ensure the filter is functioning properly and clean as needed.
- **Algae Control**:
  - Manually remove excess algae or introduce algae-eating species.

## 3. Check Terrestrial and Plant Health
- **Plant Growth**:
  - Ensure leaves are vibrant and free from yellowing or wilting.
  - Trim overgrown or dead foliage regularly.
- **Substrate**:
  - Keep soil or moss moist but not waterlogged.
  - Remove decaying organic matter to prevent mold.
- **Pests**:
  - Monitor for pests such as mites, aphids, or fungus gnats.

---

## 4. Observe the Inhabitants
- **Physical Health**:
  - Check for signs of stress, illness, discoloration, or injuries.
- **Behavior**:
  - Look for normal feeding, activity, and social behaviors.
- **Shedding**:
  - Ensure proper humidity to support shedding in reptiles or amphibians.
- **Feeding**:
  - Monitor food consumption and avoid overfeeding.

---

## 5. Maintain Ecosystem Balance
- **Waste Management**:
  - Remove uneaten food and animal waste promptly.
  - Use cleanup crews like springtails or isopods to manage waste on land.
- **Water-Terrestrial Interaction**:
  - Ensure smooth integration of land and water zones for inhabitants.
- **Biodiversity**:
  - Maintain a balance of species to prevent overpopulation or competition.

---

## 6. Prevent Common Issues
- **Mold and Fungus**:
  - Increase airflow and adjust humidity to prevent mold.
- **Parasites**:
  - Quarantine new plants or animals before introducing them.
- **Overgrowth**:
  - Prune plants and clean water features to avoid overcrowding.

---

## 7. Keep a Maintenance Routine
- **Daily**:
  - Check animal behavior, temperature, and humidity.
  - Remove debris.
- **Weekly**:
  - Test water quality and perform small water changes (10–20%).
- **Monthly**:
  - Deep clean filters, prune plants, and inspect the habitat.
